🚀 Steam Games Recommendation System
Welcome to the Steam Games Recommendation System, a hybrid recommendation engine designed to provide highly personalized and diverse game suggestions for users on the Steam platform. By combining content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and popularity metrics, this system offers tailored recommendations that align with individual preferences while staying relevant to market trends.

📖 Overview
With thousands of games available on Steam, finding the perfect game can be overwhelming. Our recommendation system addresses this challenge by leveraging multiple data sources and advanced machine learning techniques to deliver accurate and meaningful suggestions.

Key Features:
Hybrid Recommendation Approach: Integrates content-based and collaborative filtering with popularity metrics for robust suggestions.
Personalization: Tailors recommendations to individual user preferences using advanced sentiment analysis and clustering.
Diversity: Highlights trending games while ensuring a variety of genres and playstyles are recommended.
🗂️ Datasets Used

Game Descriptions:
Contains data for over 5,000 games, including genres, descriptions, player ratings, and system requirements.
Powers content-based filtering by analyzing game attributes.

Player Reviews:
Includes 100,000+ reviews with feedback, playtime, recommendations, and sentiments.
Enables collaborative filtering through user interaction data.

Game Rankings:
Ranks games based on sales, revenue, and reviews.
Used to compute popularity scores and incorporate trending games.

⚙️ Methodology
1. Content-Based Filtering
Vectorization: Game descriptions are transformed into vector representations using Doc2Vec.
Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity between game vectors identifies similar games

2. Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Decomposition: User-game interaction data is decomposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
𝑅≈𝑈Σ𝑉^𝑇
Preference Prediction: Missing ratings are predicted by reconstructing the interaction matrix.

4. Popularity Metrics
Combines genre rankings, review counts, and cluster trends (via K-Means) to compute a weighted popularity score.

6. Hybrid Scoring Mechanism
Combines content-based, collaborative, and popularity scores into a final recommendation score:
Hybrid Score = 𝑤𝑐.Content Score + 𝑤𝑐𝑓⋅Collaborative Score + 𝑤𝑝⋅Popularity Score

🔍 Key Results
Personalized Recommendations: Tailored suggestions based on individual preferences and behavior.
Diverse Outputs: Incorporates both user preferences and trending games for a balanced recommendation.

📈 Future Directions
Real-Time Updates: Integrate live data processing to adapt to evolving preferences and market trends.
Enhanced Sentiment Analysis: Expand sentiment analysis using gameplay metrics to refine recommendations.
Social Integration: Leverage multiplayer activity and friends’ preferences to create community-driven recommendations.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for building the system.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Natural Language Processing: Doc2Vec for vectorizing game descriptions.
Clustering: K-Means for user segmentation.
Matrix Factorization: SVD for collaborative filtering.
